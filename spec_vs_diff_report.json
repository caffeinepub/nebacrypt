  "summary": "The diff modifies LandingPage.tsx but the change described in the file summary targets the overlay text 'Informasjon om vår teknologi' (using text-white font-semibold drop-shadow-md and darkening the gradient overlay), rather than explicitly targeting the first <p> inside the third div of the ICP teaser section with a dark foreground color class like text-gray-900. The truncated diff does not show the specific paragraph element being changed to a dark high-contrast color class. The change appears to address overlay/image text contrast rather than the paragraph text element specified by the XPath.",
