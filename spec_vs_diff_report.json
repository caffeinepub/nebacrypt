      "requirement": "Update the Internet Identity description text in LandingPage.tsx and ClientPortal.tsx (in addition to PublicSubmissionForm.tsx) to reflect Internet Identity 2.0 capabilities: passkeys, Google, Apple, and Microsoft sign-in.",
      "reason": "The diff shows PublicSubmissionForm.tsx was updated with II 2.0 description. The file summaries for LandingPage.tsx and ClientPortal.tsx do not mention any Internet Identity description update — LandingPage.tsx summary only mentions hero section and contact section changes, and ClientPortal.tsx summary only mentions mobile navigation improvements. No evidence of II 2.0 description updates in those files.",
