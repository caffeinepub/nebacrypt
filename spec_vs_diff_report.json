  "summary": "The diff modifies ICPInfoPage.tsx along with some ancillary files. The truncated ICPInfoPage.tsx content does not explicitly show the three required changes (heading text, text color, blur amount), but the file is confirmed modified. The file-summaries.txt references LandingPage changes but not ICPInfoPage changes specifically. Without seeing the full ICPInfoPage.tsx diff content (it was truncated), it is difficult to confirm all three requirements are implemented. The project_state.json lists all three as 'pending', which may simply be the pre-change state snapshot.",
