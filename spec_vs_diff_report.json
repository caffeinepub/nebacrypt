  "summary": "The diff modifies the Footer component to give the Nebacrypt logo banner image a full-width container with w-full on both the container div and the img element, using h-auto object-contain to prevent cropping. This directly addresses REQ-1. No overflow-hidden is applied to the parent container. The changes align well with all acceptance criteria.",
