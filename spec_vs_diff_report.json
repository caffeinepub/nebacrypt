The 'Nebadon Encryption AS' standalone element is absent from the new Footer.tsx, and the copyright line reads '© {currentYear} – Alle rettigheter forbeholdes' with caffeine.ai attribution preserved, removing 'Nebadon Encryption' from the copyright line. The rest of the footer (logo, org number, Oslo address, caffeine.ai) remains intact.",
