# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Implement professional HTML email templates with customer signature featuring the Nebadon Encryption logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Create HTML email templates with greeting, list-formatted content, and signature section
- Add Nebadon Encryption logo to customer email signatures with clickable link to nencrypt.com
- Implement plain-text fallback versions for all templates
- Update backend email logic to use HTML templates for customer notifications (status updates, confirmations)
- Keep admin notification emails simple (plain-text, no logo or signature)

**User-visible outcome:** Customers receive professional, branded emails with clear formatting and company signature, while admin notifications remain simple and focused.
