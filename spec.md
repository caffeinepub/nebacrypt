# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the company name "Nebadon Encryption AS" and "Nebadon Encryption" from the footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the standalone "Nebadon Encryption AS" text element from the footer
- Remove "Nebadon Encryption" from the copyright line, leaving only "Copyright 2026" and any caffeine.ai attribution

**User-visible outcome:** The footer no longer displays the company name in any form, while all other footer content (logo, org number, address, caffeine.ai attribution) remains unchanged.
