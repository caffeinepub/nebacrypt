# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add three new songs to the top of the track list on the Music page.

**Planned changes:**
- Add "Unbreakable Signal" (https://suno.com/s/owSmEgAmBXYqVuZt) as the first entry in the track list on MusicPage.tsx
- Add "Tasten - din venn eller fiende?" (https://suno.com/s/TiV9L1eSJsCOdCCs) as the second entry
- Add "Caffeine A.I. Code Rush" (https://suno.com/s/BldXyW2xM1nW1C4U) as the third entry
- All three entries appear above existing tracks and use the same style/component as existing tracks

**User-visible outcome:** Users visiting the Music page will see three new clickable song links at the top of the list, matching the existing visual style.
