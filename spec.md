# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reorder elements in the footer column so that the social/contact icons element appears above the address/contact details block.

**Planned changes:**
- In the Footer component, move the social/contact icons element (currently the third div in the second footer column group) to render above the address block in that same column.

**User-visible outcome:** The social/contact icons are displayed above the address in the footer column, with all other footer content and layout remaining unchanged.
