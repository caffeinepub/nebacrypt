# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the "Tjenester" nav item and update Internet Identity descriptions to reflect II 2.0 capabilities.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove "Tjenester" (Services) from both the desktop and mobile navigation menu in Header.tsx
- Update Internet Identity description text across relevant pages (e.g. LandingPage.tsx, PublicSubmissionForm.tsx, ClientPortal.tsx) to mention passkeys, Google, Apple, and Microsoft sign-in support

**User-visible outcome:** The navigation no longer shows "Tjenester", and any Internet Identity descriptions in the UI accurately reflect II 2.0 features including passkeys and social sign-in options.
